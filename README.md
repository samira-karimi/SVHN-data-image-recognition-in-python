# SVHN-data
Different models will be used for this set of data to find the final proper model. 
The work is still in progress.
1. The first model is a simple 5-layer CNN. There is no validation set in this version, only training and test sets exist.
This model get 91.6% training accuracy and 88.3% test accuracy. We seem to have some bias and some overfitting problem, though not very high. I will try to cure this in the next versions!
2. The code for the second model is provided, however, my computer had a problem and stoped compiling after epoch 90! This file will be updated with the final results once I get my computer fixed. This could be due to the high colume of the data. To avoid this, gray scale conversion may be utilized.
